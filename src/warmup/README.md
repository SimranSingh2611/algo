This type and level of tasks is intended to be the first warm-up question to get you started during the interview.

Based on what I've read and experienced during various face 2 face rounds of interviews, there are several expectations from you:
* **You come up with an optimal solution right away**. These questions are usually not too complex. Brute-force and further optimization is not good
* **You don't have any bugs**. Again, if you have bugs when solving simple tasks, it is not cool
* **You are fast**. Ideally it should not take more than 5-10 minutes so that you leave time for a more complex problem that will follow

[This blog](http://larrr.com/) suggests practicing writing concise code which ultimately saves you time.
My personal example: whenever possible write ```Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();``` instead of ```Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<String, Integer>();```
